## Outline
I've completed both infinity scroll and paginate view. You can view both components using the navigation on the top. The total time it took to complete this challenge is about 5 hours is split out between a couple of days as I am still trying to wrap up my current work. I decided to use a new UI library that I had recently been interested in implementing so some time was taken to get myself familiarize with the documentation and also extra time was taken in adding some more styling and responsiveness to the application. I wanted to implement both features as pagination seems to be the easiest, but I have never implemented an infinity scroll before and felt like an interesting challenge. Researching on how others implement similar feature took about 40 minutes, and about similar time in setting up the feature and tweaking around to fit my need. 

## Set Up 
This challenge was completed using ReactJS. The repo is created with create-react-app. Please use npm to install the packages using 'npm install', then simply use 'npm start' to run the app. 

## UI Library 

I implemented ant-design library as it contains simple to use ui elements for ReactJS in order to quickly add some styling to each page.
