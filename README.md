## Outline
I've completed both infinity scroll and paginate view. You can view both components using the navigation on the top. The total time it took to complete this challenge is about under 5 hours is split out between a couple of days as I am still trying to wrap up my current work. I decided to use a new UI library that I had recently been interested in implementing so some time was taken to get myself familiarize with the documentation and also extra time was taken in adding some more styling and responsiveness to the application, time taken was around the 1 hour range. Pagination took less than 1 hour including research. I wanted to implement both features as pagination seems to be the easiest, but I have never implemented an infinity scroll before and felt like an interesting challenge. Researching on how others implement infinity scroll took about 40 minutes to see a few ways others have approached similar problem, and about an hour in implementing it myself and tweaking around to fit my need. I took extra time during implementation because I wanted to understand in detail how to control the scrolling so that it only makes requests at a certain point near the page. The remainder of an hour was in trying to create and style the pages including having a home page with a carousel. 

## Set Up 
This challenge was completed using ReactJS. The repo is created with create-react-app. Please use npm to install the packages using 'npm install', then simply use 'npm start' to run the app.

## UI Library 

I implemented ant-design library as it contains simple to use ui elements for ReactJS in order to quickly add some styling to each page.
